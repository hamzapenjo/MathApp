Introduction
------------

The Math Practice App is an engaging educational tool designed to help users improve their basic math skills through interactive gameplay. Built using modern Android development tools like Jetpack Compose and ViewModel, the app provides a user-friendly interface that encourages learning in a fun and engaging way. This comprehensive documentation provides a detailed look into the architecture, key components, and interactions within the app.

App Architecture
----------------

### Components Overview

The Math Practice App is structured around several main components that work together to create a cohesive user experience:

1.  **MainActivity.kt**: This serves as the entry point of the application. It initializes the app, sets up the UI using Jetpack Compose, and manages different screens using a Scaffold.
    
2.  **AppScaffold**: A Composable function that acts as the primary UI container. It uses Material3's Scaffold to manage different screens such as the start screen, game screen, and about screen based on the current screen state.
    
3.  **GameViewModel.kt**: A ViewModel responsible for managing the game's state and business logic. It provides data to the UI and handles game-related operations such as calculating answers, updating scores, and managing time.
    

### MainActivity.kt

#### Purpose

The MainActivity serves as the entry point for the app and is responsible for setting up the initial UI and managing the app's lifecycle. Here's a detailed breakdown of its components and functions:

*   **Entry Point**: The onCreate() method initializes the app, sets up the UI using the MathPracticeTheme, and sets the AppScaffold as the content of the app.
    
*   **Edge-to-Edge Display**: The enableEdgeToEdge() function is used to enable edge-to-edge display capabilities, providing a more immersive user experience.
    
*   **Composable Functions**: The StartScreen(), AboutGameScreen(), and AppScaffold() are Composable functions used to define the UI structure and content of the app. They utilize Jetpack Compose's declarative UI approach to build and update the UI based on the app's state.
    
*   **Share Score Functionality**: The shareScore() function allows users to share their scores using Android's share functionality, promoting engagement and social sharing.
    

### AppScaffold

#### Purpose

The AppScaffold is a Composable function that acts as the main UI container for the app. It manages different screens (StartScreen, GameScreen, \`AboutGameScreen) based on the current screen state.

#### Key Components

*   **Scaffold**: Utilizes Material3's Scaffold component to manage the app layout and navigation between different screens.
    
*   **TopAppBar**: Displays the app title and an action button (share button in GameScreen) using the TopAppBar component from Material3.
    
*   **Conditional Content**: Uses a when (currentScreen) block to switch between different screens (StartScreen, GameScreen, AboutGameScreen) based on the currentScreen state.
    

### StartScreen

#### Purpose

The StartScreen is the initial screen of the app that allows users to start the game or view game instructions.

#### Key Components

*   **StartScreen()**: A Composable function that displays the title of the app and buttons for starting the game and viewing game instructions.
    
*   **AboutGameScreen()**: A Composable function that displays instructions about the game and a back button to return to the start screen.
    

### GameScreen

#### Purpose

The GameScreen is where the main gameplay takes place. It displays math problems, accepts user input, and manages game state such as score and time.

#### Key Components

*   **GameScreen()**: A Composable function that displays the game interface, including math problems, user input fields, buttons to submit answers and restart the game, and displays the user's score and remaining time.
    
*   **Game Logic Functions**: submitAnswer(), restartGame(), and updateTimeRemaining() manage game logic such as checking answers, restarting the game, and updating the remaining time.
    

### ViewModel (GameViewModel.kt)

#### Purpose

The GameViewModel manages the UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way. It survives configuration changes such as screen rotations.

#### Key Components

*   **State Variables**: \_score, \_num1, \_num2, \_operator, and \_timeRemaining store the current game state such as score, numbers, operator, and time.
    
*   **Computed Properties**: questionText generates the question text based on current numbers and operator.
    
*   **Functions**: submitAnswer(), restartGame(), and updateTimeRemaining() manage game logic such as answering questions, checking correctness, and updating scores.
    
*   **Helper Functions**: getRandomOperator(), calculateCorrectAnswer(), isAnswerCorrect() are utility functions for generating random operators and calculating/validating answers.
    

### Utility Functions

#### Key Utility Functions

*   **shareScore()**: Shares the user's score using Android's share functionality.
    
*   **getRandomOperator()**: Generates a random math operator (+, -, \*, /).
    
*   **calculateCorrectAnswer()** and **isAnswerCorrect()**: Helper functions to calculate the correct answer for a math problem and validate the user's answer.
    

Detailed Explanation of Core Components
---------------------------------------

### Compose UI

Jetpack Compose is used for building the UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development with its declarative approach.

#### Key Composables Used

*   **Column**, **Spacer**, **Button**, **Text**, **TextField**: For arranging UI elements and accepting user input.
    
*   **Scaffold**, **TopAppBar**, **IconButton**, **Surface**: For managing app-level navigation and providing app bar functionality.
    
*   **MaterialTheme**: Provides the design system and theming for the app.
    

### ViewModel

#### Purpose

The GameViewModel holds the data related to the game state and provides data to the UI. It survives configuration changes such as screen rotations.

#### Key Components

*   **State Variables**: \_score, \_num1, \_num2, \_operator, \_timeRemaining store the current game state.
    
*   **Computed Properties**: questionText generates the question text based on the current numbers and operator.
    
*   **Functions**: submitAnswer(), restartGame(), and updateTimeRemaining() manage game logic such as checking answers, restarting the game, and updating the remaining time.
    
*   **Helper Functions**: getRandomOperator(), calculateCorrectAnswer(), isAnswerCorrect() are utility functions for generating random operators and calculating/validating answers.
    

### Utility Functions

#### Key Utility Functions

*   **shareScore()**: Shares the user's score using Android's share functionality.
    
*   **getRandomOperator()**: Generates a random math operator (+, -, \*, /).
